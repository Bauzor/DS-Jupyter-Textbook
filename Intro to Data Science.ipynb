I will be using a the titanic data set to go through different concepts and how to implement them on the titanic data set. There will be four other data sets provided alongside the Titanic data set for you to apply the strategies and concepts to. I would advise you to try and not move on to the next section until you can do all the practice problems without scrolling back up to the examples that are shown. If there are any errors, please let me know. Enjoy!</p>"

    "<p>The data set above is ugly and hard to work with. The job of a data scientist is to turn this data into something more user-friendly so that we can draw some conclusions and answer certain questions. This is done by taking information and performing statistical analysis upon the information and then applying computer science algorithms to process, visualize and predict with said data. However, note that a data scientist may or may not be familiar with the field of information the data scientist is working with and thus a specialist of the subject is generally important when it comes to making certain decisions. Thus, as a data scientist, it is important that we are always open to learning about a variety of subjects from determining what song to suggest a user, to predicting housing prices.</p>"
